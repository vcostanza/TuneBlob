## Overview
TuneBlob is a simple Android app for aiding with musical tuning. It has 3 different visualization modes:
- Radial meter - Traditional radial tuning meter with a rotating pointer line that shows microtonal variation
- Graph meter - Tones are represented by lines on a grid that resembles a piano roll
- Dual meter - Both the radial and graph meters are shown side by side

Users can switch between these modes using the left-most buttons on the action bar.

## Requirements
- Android 6.0 Marshmallow or newer (tested with Android 7.1, 9, and 11)
- Access to the device microphone (since this is an audio-based tuner)

## Features
- Several customizable display settings for the graph meter
- Gesture and settings-based zoom controls for the graph meter
- Audio input volume and frequency filtering
- Customizable tuning standard (440 Hz by default)
- Action bar button to switch between day and night theme

## TODO
- Option for changing the input microphone

## Purpose
Besides its utility as a musical tuner (of which there are many), I created this app to learn Kotlin and brush up on my knowledge of OpenGL and C++.
This is also the first Android app I've created and released outside of a professional context. Truth be told I don't primarily consider myself an Android developer despite doing it professionally since 2015.
