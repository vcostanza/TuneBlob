  FFT.h

  This file contains a few FFT routines, including a real-FFT
  routine that is almost twice as fast as a normal complex FFT,
  and a power spectrum routine which is more convenient when
  you know you don't care about phase information.  It now also
  contains a few basic windowing functions.

  Some of this code was based on a free implementation of an FFT
  by Don Cross, available on the web at:

    http://www.intersrv.com/~dcross/fft.html

  The basic algorithm for his code was based on Numerical Recipes
  in Fortran.  I optimized his code further by reducing array
  accesses, caching the bit reversal table, and eliminating
  float-to-double conversions, and I added the routines to
  calculate a real FFT and a real power spectrum.

  Note: all of these routines use single-precision floats.
  I have found that in practice, floats work well until you
  get above 8192 samples.  If you need to do a larger FFT,
  you need to use doubles.
